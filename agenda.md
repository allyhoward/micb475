# ﻿W4-TM: Week 4 Team Meeting: September 27

## Agenda
1 Introduction and coding experience
2 Exploration of research ideas and metadata sets
3 Selection of collaboration tool for lab notebook

## Meeting Minutes
* Everyone has some level of coding knowledge from past coursework.
* Dataset Consideration: Zoo Metadata
        * Research focus: Evaluating animal health by comparing weights and analyzing microbiome data.
        * Approach: categorization of animals - create a structured list of categories for the captive and non-captive animals in the dataset.
* Collaboration Platform: GitHub
        * Assigned a designated member to take responsibility for recording meeting minutes.
        * Meeting agenda must be submitted to Avril by Tuesday midnight for review.
        * Lab notebook should be updated regularly throughout the project.

## Action Items
* Prepare agenda for the next group meeting
* Read over the zoo metadata and associate paper
* Generate potential research questions and share
* Review proposal and lab notebook module
* Create GitHub account


# W4-TM: Week 5 Team Meeting: October 4

## Agenda
1 Review previous meeting minutes
2 Share research questions and finalize the topic (possible questions below)
        * Does country of captivity have an effect on the gut microbiome of captive animals
        * Is body mass between wild and captive animals correlated with changes in gut microbiome
        * How is the gut microbiome of mammalian animals affected by their habitat type (terrestrial or arboreal) and captivity status (captive or wild) → compare bacterial diversity across the four combinations
3 Ask for supplemental data from authors?
4 Notebook formatting (paper copy? notebook code?)

## Meeting Minutes
* Zoo metadata is referenced wrongly (e.g., body mass, age of birth)
        * Reach out to the researcher for clarification → takes a long time
* Switching to new datasets
        * Anemia & infant feeding
            * Concerns: another group is already doing these two metadata, overlap between the two sets is limited
        * Tanzania
        * Soil samples following logging & in the wetland
            * Ideas: similar bacterial diversity and environmental composition? ‘Tree cover’ - filter specific tree types and investigate the soil types
            * Possible focus: looking at differences between groups that have Douglas firs in BC but with different soil types, moisture content in the microbiome
                * Try to get stuff from the same location
                * Look through old papers to see what has been done before
                * Beta-diversity plot to check if the latitude variable differs a lot
* Notebook format - digital is fine
* Lab proposal
        * 3 aims - alpha & beta diversity, differential abundance (statically differences in bacteria vs. community),  indicator taxa (smaller amount of bacteria with strong differences)
        * Check additional resources for other interesting analysis types (picrust, GO enrichment, Kegg terms)
        * Can switch research direction after the proposal is done

## Action Items
    * Share one credential so we can all work on the same QIIME server
    * review soil metadata and propose a list of new research questions and email to Avril
