Title: Initial data processing with QIIME 2
Purpose: To generate features tables for downstream analysis, this experiment will import the soil dataset and perform
demultiplexing, denoising and ASV determination, assign taxonomic information to the ASVs, and filter the dataset
to remove mitochondria and chloroplast data, and subset the final features table according to the projectâ€™s research
questions (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B).

Jastina working on code for proposal.
Ran DADA2 for 12 hours and successfully denoised the dataset.
Retraining the classifier unsuccessfully... 
Met with the error that we are not using FeatureData[Sequence] artifact but are using TaxonomicClassifier
Trying this now: https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.9/tutorials/feature-classifier/
