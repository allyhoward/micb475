# W12-TM: Week 12 Team Meeting: November 22

## Agenda

* Go through the data summary
* Alpha and Beta Diversity Plots - technically complete but alpha significance tests are slightly concerning...
  *  trying it with different metrics? But then the t-test code doesn't run???
  *  put all the stuff into slides - would appreciate everyone's opinion!
* Downstream errors and issues after ISA filtering
  * could it be due to NA and 0?
  * should we remove the x/sum(x) code? 
* Core microbiome and heat map

## Meeting Minutes
* overview of project for Evelyn

* Alpha diversity:
  * not significant
  * only seems to be including one horizon??
  * send code to Avril!!
  * If medians fall within box of the other, not significant
  * good to show Shannon ones that diversity doesn't differ between then
* Beta diversity:
  * Weighted unifrac is better
  * can get rid of unweighted unifrac
  * less clustering, richness and phylogenetic distance are more likely to be driving diversity
  * difference in evenness is a bit less
  * can present BOTH weighted and unweighted
  * only 1.4% variance
  * draw ellipses in
  * MAKE 3 PANNELS: alpha, weighted, unweighted
 
*
