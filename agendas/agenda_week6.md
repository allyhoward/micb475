# W6-TM: Week 6 Team Meeting: October 11

## Agenda

1. Discuss finalized project question (Do microbiomes of logged Douglas fir stands in BC differ based on soil type and moisture content?)
2. Discuss denoising step (and whose credentials to use for QIIME2 work)
3. Come up with 3 objectives for our proposal
4. Decide tasks for proposal

## Meeting minutes
* Confirmed finalized project question (double check UJEMI papers to see if duplicates)
    * checked if moisture content was a continuous variable (1-100, percentage)
* Objectives for proposal
    * look at alpha a beta diversity (check if one soil type is more diverse than another)
    * differential abundance (looking for any stats difference between two values)
    * indicator taxa (looking for one really abundant / prevalent group, smaller number of species)
