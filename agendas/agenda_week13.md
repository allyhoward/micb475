# W13-TM: Week 13 Team Meeting: November 29

## Agenda

* PCA plot: should we talk about the low PC1 and PC2 precentages? Does that matter?
* Error bar plot:
  * what is the relative abundance relative to (lol)
  * looks like O horizon is on average more downregulated and A horizon upregulated?
  * should we look at individual pathways in more detail?
* Manuscript
  * UJEMI style?
  * ideal day to get you a draft for feedback?
* PCoA plots - how to add clustering elipses :(
* Thoughts on future directions? does it really address a "problem" like the rubric says?
* Practice Presentation
* Jastina: 
  * fixing plot
  * discussion of data

## Meeting minutes
* PCA plot: Don't worry about the percentages, don't even mention it - Avril
* Error bar plot:
  * relative to the entire microbiome out of a percentage of the total counts
  * don't put too much weight on the RA for unctional data
  * not so much downregulated but rather there is less of that particular function in that particular horizon
  * log2 is relative to A/O
  * maybe take a glance at the major pathways? but if it doesn't give you anything is 'cool' then don't bother
* Manuscript:
  * search up UJEMI -> for authors -> submission guidelines
  * guidelines are summarized in Module 17
  * try to get in draft manuscript by Tuesday night for guaranteed feedback from Avril 
* PCoA plots:
* ISA plot:
  * ask for help about figure legends after, for now edit axis in PP
* Future direction:
  * put it into a wider context: do other authros address which horizon they collect data from? if not, our results show a significant difference so perhaps it would be worthwhile for that to be mentioned 
* Notes on presentation:
  * emailed later
