# W11-TM: Week 11 Team Meeting: November 14

## Agenda
* help with picrust2 visualization (how do we incorporate indicator taxa?)
* is the metadata file just the original from the paper? or a filtered one?
* AIM 2:
  - we found some example papers of what we want our data to look like (https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201379)
  - what are on the x and y axis?
  - we want to make a bubble plot where the size of the dot represents relative abundance
