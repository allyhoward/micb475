# W8-TM: Week 8 Team Meeting: October 24

## Agenda

1. Go over the project proposal
2. What are next steps? How should we structure the next part of this project?

## Meeting Minutes
* discussed next steps
    * dividing who wants to do what going forward
    * start doing R
    * if anyone loves QIIME2, can start looking at PICRUSt
* set up github with R (or use github desktop app)
    * make sure to pull and push files when working on your desktop
* one person on each separate thing (alpha / beta diversity, indicator, PICRUSt) 
    * for indicator, think about how to visualize data 
    * people who finish first can help others, start compiling manuscript
    * only difference between DESeq2 and PICRUSt is literally just running PICRUSt
      * 2 people work on this together, based on stuff in QIIME2
* one person on alpha / beta, 2 on indicator, 2 on PICRUSt
* OR 1 setting up indicator (making it match up with dataset), 1 trouble shooting plots / making plots
* check out ggplot2 thing Avril sent for plot formatting
    * e.g. rotating bacteria names
    * supplementary plots too
* for PICRUSt:
    * QIIME2 --> 3 files (metapsych pathways, called "pathway")

* ROLES:
    * Jastina: indicator plot visualization
    * Ally: 
    * Fatima:
    * Vera:
    * Anu:
