# W6 - TM: Week 7 Team Meeting: Oct 18

## Agenda

1. Fatima + Jastina's questions for Avril
    * When analyzing our data, do we run test looking at moisture then soil types and THEN both?
    * Look through how we ran our QIIME2 code
    * What types of alpha/beta diversity tests should we run?

2. Is our project too similar to this other UJEMI paper (please say no) and if so how can we adapt ours to be different?:

Annual precipitation and soil moisture level strongly associate
with the bacterial community structure in Interior Douglas-fir
and Sub-Boreal Spruce ecozones in British Columbia

3. Can we use the above paper as a reference
