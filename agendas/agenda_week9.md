# W8-TM: Week 9 Team Meeting: November 1

## Agenda
* Notebooks: we have 2 right now, one on Docs and the readme (the Docs one is more updated!) Should we keep going with the doc or push to the GitHub?
* PICRUSt2: most recent version for the QIIME2 plugin looks like v2023.2 but the QIIME2 version we have on the server is 2023.7
